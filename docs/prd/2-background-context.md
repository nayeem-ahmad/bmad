# 2. Background Context
This project addresses the growing need for modern, digital tools among small to medium-sized grocery retailers in Bangladesh. Our initial research and brainstorming revealed that while various solutions exist, there is a significant opportunity for a product that prioritizes simplicity and reliability over a complex, overwhelming feature set.

The core strategy is to win the market by focusing on an exceptional user experience for the non-technical user, ensuring the platform flawlessly handles the most critical day-to-day operations: selling products and managing inventory. The architecture must be resilient and support intermittent internet connectivity. By building this strong foundation and layering advanced, localized features (like e-commerce and delivery integration) in premium tiers, we can provide a clear growth path for our customers and establish a strong competitive advantage.
