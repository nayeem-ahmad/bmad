## MVP Validation Approach

Our approach to validating the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is rooted in a tight feedback loop with a select group of early adopters. The goal is to gather actionable insights quickly to iterate on the product and confirm that our core value proposition resonates with the target market before a wider rollout.

The validation process will be conducted in three phases:

1.  **Alpha Release (Internal & Friends/Family):**
    *   **Participants:** A small, internal group of 5-10 users, including team members and trusted individuals who run or are familiar with small retail operations.
    *   **Goal:** Identify and fix critical bugs, major usability flaws, and gaps in the core transaction workflow (sell a product, update inventory).
    *   **Methodology:**
        *   Direct observation and hands-on onboarding sessions.
        *   Daily check-ins and an open channel (e.g., WhatsApp group) for immediate feedback.
    *   **Success Criteria:**
        *   The core loop of selling an item and seeing inventory decrement works reliably.
        *   Users can successfully set up their store and add initial products without assistance.
        *   All P0/P1 bugs are resolved.

2.  **Beta Release (Private, Invite-Only):**
    *   **Participants:** A curated group of 20-30 real-world small grocery shop owners in Bangladesh who have expressed prior interest.
    *   **Goal:** Validate the product's market fit, ease of use in a real-world context, and the perceived value of the Basic Tier feature set.
    *   **Methodology:**
        *   **Quantitative:** Track key metrics through in-app analytics:
            *   **User Engagement:** Daily Active Users (DAU), number of transactions processed per day.
            *   **Task Success Rate:** Percentage of users who successfully complete key workflows (e.g., add product, complete sale).
            *   **Retention:** Week 1 and Week 4 user retention.
        *   **Qualitative:**
            *   **Onboarding Interviews:** Understand first impressions and initial setup challenges.
            *   **Weekly Surveys:** Use short, targeted surveys (e.g., Net Promoter Score - NPS) to gauge satisfaction.
            *   **Exit Interviews:** For users who stop using the platform, conduct interviews to understand why.
    *   **Success Criteria:**
        *   Achieve a weekly transaction volume of at least 50 transactions per active store.
        *   A Task Success Rate of >95% for core workflows.
        *   Positive qualitative feedback indicating the product saves time and is easier to use than their current methods (or alternatives).
        *   A Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 20 or higher.

3.  **Decision Point: Go/No-Go for Public Launch:**
    *   Based on the success criteria from the Beta Release, we will make a data-informed decision.
    *   **Go:** If the metrics and feedback are positive, we will proceed with a public launch, incorporating feedback into the V1.1 roadmap.
    *   **No-Go / Pivot:** If we see low engagement, negative feedback, or a failure to meet key success criteria, we will pause the public launch. A "No-Go" decision will trigger a series of deep-dive interviews with our beta testers to diagnose the core issues, leading to a potential pivot in strategy or a significant rework of the MVP.
