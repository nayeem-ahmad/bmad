# Epic 4: Manufacturing & Supply Chain

**Expanded Goal:** This epic extends the platform's capabilities beyond simple retail to support businesses that manufacture their own products. It provides the tools to define multi-level bills of materials, manage production runs, and track the consumption of raw materials, fully integrating the manufacturing process with the core inventory and sales systems.

**Story 4.1: Bill of Materials (BOM) Management**
*   As a Manufacturer, I want to define a Bill of Materials (BOM) for my finished products, so that I can specify the raw materials required to produce them.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  A user can designate an inventory item as a "Manufactured Good".
    2.  For a manufactured good, the user can create a BOM by adding other inventory items (raw materials) and their required quantities.
    3.  The system supports multi-level BOMs, where a raw material in one BOM can itself be a manufactured good with its own BOM.

**Story 4.2: Production Order Management**
*   As a Manufacturer, I want to create and manage Production Orders, so that I can initiate and track manufacturing runs.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  A user can create a Production Order for a specific manufactured good and quantity.
    2.  Creating the order does not immediately affect any inventory stock levels.
    3.  The user can view a list of all production orders and their statuses (e.g., "Planned", "In Progress", "Completed").

**Story 4.3: Production Order Execution**
*   As a Manufacturer, I want to execute a completed Production Order, so that my inventory levels for raw materials and finished goods are updated correctly.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  A user can mark a Production Order with a "Planned" or "In Progress" status as "Completed".
    2.  Upon completion, the system correctly decrements the stock levels of all raw materials as defined in the product's BOM.
    3.  Upon completion, the system correctly increments the stock level of the finished manufactured good.
