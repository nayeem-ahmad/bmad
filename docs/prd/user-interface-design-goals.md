# User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
The UX vision is centered on radical simplicity and reliability. The interface must be immediately understandable and usable by a small grocery shop owner in Bangladesh who may have limited technical literacy. It should feel clean, uncluttered, and fast, prioritizing core workflows over feature density.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
The primary interaction will be touch-friendly for use on tablets or mobile devices at the POS, but also fully functional with a standard keyboard and mouse. Key paradigms will include large, clear buttons for common actions, minimal data entry fields, and a consistent, predictable layout across all modules.

### Core Screens and Views
From a product perspective, the most critical screens to deliver the core value are:
*   Point of Sale (POS) Interface
*   Inventory Management Dashboard
*   Sales & Online Orders Overview
*   E-commerce Customer View (for the shop's customers)
*   Settings

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
The system should adhere to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA to be usable by people with disabilities.

### Branding
No specific branding guidelines have been provided. The initial design should be clean, professional, and use a modern, neutral color palette. Custom branding can be applied later.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive & Mobile App
The primary platform will be a responsive web application that works across desktops, tablets, and mobile phones. This will be complemented by a native mobile app for store owners to manage their business on the go.
