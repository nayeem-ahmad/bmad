# Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo
All code for this project (frontend, backend, infrastructure) will be housed in a single repository (a monorepo).

### Service Architecture: Modular Monolith
The application will be built as a single, well-structured monolithic service. The internal design will be highly modular to allow for a potential future migration to microservices if required by scale.

### Testing Requirements: Unit + Integration Tests
The quality strategy will focus on a strong foundation of unit tests for individual components and integration tests to verify that these components work together correctly.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
*   The application will be deployed to a major cloud provider (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure) using containerization (e.g., Docker).
*   A relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) will be used as the primary data store.
*   The backend will be built with a modern, strongly-typed language (e.g., TypeScript with Node.js, Go, or Kotlin).
*   The frontend will be a modern single-page application (SPA) framework (e.g., React, Vue, or Svelte).
