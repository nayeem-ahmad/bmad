# SaaS Platform for Grocery Shops Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Goals
*   Deliver a compelling and affordable SaaS platform specifically for small to medium-sized grocery shops in Bangladesh.
*   Provide a clear, two-tiered subscription model (Basic and Premium) to cater to different levels of operational complexity.
*   Ensure the Basic Tier is simple, reliable, and exceptionally easy to use for non-technical business owners.
*   Enable critical, market-specific features including local payment gateways (bKash/Nagad) and a Bangla language UI.
*   Establish a robust platform that can scale to support advanced capabilities such as e-commerce, delivery management, and manufacturing in premium tiers.

## 2. Background Context
This project addresses the growing need for modern, digital tools among small to medium-sized grocery retailers in Bangladesh. Our initial research and brainstorming revealed that while various solutions exist, there is a significant opportunity for a product that prioritizes simplicity and reliability over a complex, overwhelming feature set.

The core strategy is to win the market by focusing on an exceptional user experience for the non-technical user, ensuring the platform flawlessly handles the most critical day-to-day operations: selling products and managing inventory. The architecture must be resilient and support intermittent internet connectivity. By building this strong foundation and layering advanced, localized features (like e-commerce and delivery integration) in premium tiers, we can provide a clear growth path for our customers and establish a strong competitive advantage.

### MVP Validation Approach

Our approach to validating the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is rooted in a tight feedback loop with a select group of early adopters. The goal is to gather actionable insights quickly to iterate on the product and confirm that our core value proposition resonates with the target market before a wider rollout.

The validation process will be conducted in three phases:

1.  **Alpha Release (Internal & Friends/Family):**
    *   **Participants:** A small, internal group of 5-10 users, including team members and trusted individuals who run or are familiar with small retail operations.
    *   **Goal:** Identify and fix critical bugs, major usability flaws, and gaps in the core transaction workflow (sell a product, update inventory).
    *   **Methodology:**
        *   Direct observation and hands-on onboarding sessions.
        *   Daily check-ins and an open channel (e.g., WhatsApp group) for immediate feedback.
    *   **Success Criteria:**
        *   The core loop of selling an item and seeing inventory decrement works reliably.
        *   Users can successfully set up their store and add initial products without assistance.
        *   All P0/P1 bugs are resolved.

2.  **Beta Release (Private, Invite-Only):**
    *   **Participants:** A curated group of 20-30 real-world small grocery shop owners in Bangladesh who have expressed prior interest.
    *   **Goal:** Validate the product's market fit, ease of use in a real-world context, and the perceived value of the Basic Tier feature set.
    *   **Methodology:**
        *   **Quantitative:** Track key metrics through in-app analytics:
            *   **User Engagement:** Daily Active Users (DAU), number of transactions processed per day.
            *   **Task Success Rate:** Percentage of users who successfully complete key workflows (e.g., add product, complete sale).
            *   **Retention:** Week 1 and Week 4 user retention.
        *   **Qualitative:**
            *   **Onboarding Interviews:** Understand first impressions and initial setup challenges.
            *   **Weekly Surveys:** Use short, targeted surveys (e.g., Net Promoter Score - NPS) to gauge satisfaction.
            *   **Exit Interviews:** For users who stop using the platform, conduct interviews to understand why.
    *   **Success Criteria:**
        *   Achieve a weekly transaction volume of at least 50 transactions per active store.
        *   A Task Success Rate of >95% for core workflows.
        *   Positive qualitative feedback indicating the product saves time and is easier to use than their current methods (or alternatives).
        *   A Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 20 or higher.

3.  **Decision Point: Go/No-Go for Public Launch:**
    *   Based on the success criteria from the Beta Release, we will make a data-informed decision.
    *   **Go:** If the metrics and feedback are positive, we will proceed with a public launch, incorporating feedback into the V1.1 roadmap.
    *   **No-Go / Pivot:** If we see low engagement, negative feedback, or a failure to meet key success criteria, we will pause the public launch. A "No-Go" decision will trigger a series of deep-dive interviews with our beta testers to diagnose the core issues, leading to a potential pivot in strategy or a significant rework of the MVP.

## User Interface Design Goals

#### Overall UX Vision
The UX vision is centered on radical simplicity and reliability. The interface must be immediately understandable and usable by a small grocery shop owner in Bangladesh who may have limited technical literacy. It should feel clean, uncluttered, and fast, prioritizing core workflows over feature density.

#### Key Interaction Paradigms
The primary interaction will be touch-friendly for use on tablets or mobile devices at the POS, but also fully functional with a standard keyboard and mouse. Key paradigms will include large, clear buttons for common actions, minimal data entry fields, and a consistent, predictable layout across all modules.

#### Core Screens and Views
From a product perspective, the most critical screens to deliver the core value are:
*   Point of Sale (POS) Interface
*   Inventory Management Dashboard
*   Sales & Online Orders Overview
*   E-commerce Customer View (for the shop's customers)
*   Settings

#### Accessibility: WCAG AA
The system should adhere to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA to be usable by people with disabilities.

#### Branding
No specific branding guidelines have been provided. The initial design should be clean, professional, and use a modern, neutral color palette. Custom branding can be applied later.

#### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive & Mobile App
The primary platform will be a responsive web application that works across desktops, tablets, and mobile phones. This will be complemented by a native mobile app for store owners to manage their business on the go.

---

## Technical Assumptions

#### Repository Structure: Monorepo
All code for this project (frontend, backend, infrastructure) will be housed in a single repository (a monorepo).

#### Service Architecture: Modular Monolith
The application will be built as a single, well-structured monolithic service. The internal design will be highly modular to allow for a potential future migration to microservices if required by scale.

#### Testing Requirements: Unit + Integration Tests
The quality strategy will focus on a strong foundation of unit tests for individual components and integration tests to verify that these components work together correctly.

#### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
*   The application will be deployed to a major cloud provider (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure) using containerization (e.g., Docker).
*   A relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) will be used as the primary data store.
*   The backend will be built with a modern, strongly-typed language (e.g., TypeScript with Node.js, Go, or Kotlin).
*   The frontend will be a modern single-page application (SPA) framework (e.g., React, Vue, or Svelte).
