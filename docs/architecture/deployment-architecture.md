# Deployment Architecture

This section defines the strategy for deploying the application to staging and production environments. Our architecture is designed for continuous deployment using Vercel and GitHub.

### Deployment Strategy

The entire full-stack Next.js application will be deployed as a single unit to Vercel.

- **Platform:** Vercel
- **Deployment Method:** Git Integration. Vercel will be connected to our GitHub repository.
    - A `git push` to the `main` branch will automatically trigger a **production deployment**.
    - A `git push` to any other branch (e.g., a feature branch in a pull request) will automatically trigger a **preview deployment** with a unique URL.

### CI/CD Pipeline

The CI/CD pipeline is managed by Vercel's GitHub integration. The process is as follows:

1.  **Push:** A developer pushes code to a GitHub branch.
2.  **Build:** Vercel automatically pulls the code, installs dependencies (`npm install`), and runs the build command (`npm run build`).
3.  **Test:** Unit and integration tests can be added as a step in the build process.
4.  **Deploy:** If the build and tests are successful, Vercel deploys the application and assigns it a URL.

Here is a conceptual `workflow.yaml` for GitHub Actions, which Vercel's integration automates:

```yaml
# This is a conceptual representation. Vercel handles this automatically.
name: Deploy to Vercel
on: [push]
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Install, Build, and Deploy
        # Vercel's platform detects the Next.js project and runs the
        # appropriate commands, linking the deployment to the commit.
        # Secrets (environment variables) are managed in Vercel's UI.
        run: |
          echo "Vercel handles this step automatically."
          echo "Connect the GitHub repo in the Vercel project settings."
```

### Environments

We will use three primary environments:

| Environment | URL | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Development** | `localhost:3000` | Local development on developer machines. |
| **Staging / Preview** | `[branch-name]-project.vercel.app` | Automatically generated for every pull request. Used for testing and review before merging. |
| **Production** | `your-production-domain.com` | The live application accessible to end-users. Deployed from the `main` branch. |
