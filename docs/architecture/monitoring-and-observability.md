# Monitoring and Observability

This section outlines the tools and key metrics we will use to monitor the health, performance, and usage of the application.

### Monitoring Stack

Our monitoring strategy leverages the built-in capabilities of our chosen platforms (Vercel and Supabase) for the initial implementation.

- **Frontend Monitoring:**
    - **Vercel Analytics:** For real-user monitoring (RUM), including Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS), page views, and visitor demographics.
    - **Vercel Logs:** For real-time logging of any client-side errors or console output.

- **Backend Monitoring:**
    - **Vercel Functions Dashboard:** To monitor the health of our serverless API routes, including execution time, memory usage, invocation counts, and error rates.
    - **Vercel Logs:** For real-time logs from our backend API routes.

- **Database Monitoring:**
    - **Supabase Dashboard:** To monitor database health, query performance, index usage, and resource utilization.

- **Error Tracking (Future Enhancement):**
    - For more advanced error aggregation, alerting, and analysis, a dedicated service like **Sentry** or **Logtail** can be integrated. For the MVP, we will rely on the real-time logs from Vercel.

### Key Metrics

We will track the following key metrics to ensure the application is performing well:

- **Frontend Performance Metrics:**
    - **Core Web Vitals:** All three metrics (LCP, FID, CLS) should be in the "Good" range as reported by Vercel Analytics.
    - **JavaScript Error Rate:** The rate of unhandled client-side exceptions should be below **0.1%** of all page views.

- **Backend Performance Metrics:**
    - **API Error Rate:** The percentage of API requests that result in a 5xx server error should be below **0.1%**.
    - **API Latency (P95):** The 95th percentile response time for all core API endpoints should remain under **200ms**.
    - **Cold Start Duration:** The P95 cold start duration for serverless functions should be monitored and kept under **1 second**.

- **Business & Usage Metrics:**
    - Daily/Weekly Active Users (DAU/WAU)
    - Number of sales processed per day
    - New user sign-ups

## Architectural Decision Records (ADR)

This section records the context, decision, and consequences for key architectural choices.

### ADR-001: Platform and Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) Choice

-   **Status:** Accepted
-   **Context:** The project is a greenfield SaaS platform for small grocery shops. Key requirements include rapid MVP development, scalability, ease of deployment, and a relational database. The development team is small and needs to focus on feature delivery over infrastructure management.
-   **Decision:** We will use **Vercel** for hosting/deployment and **Supabase** as our Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS). Vercel offers a seamless Git-based workflow for Next.js, while Supabase provides a managed PostgreSQL database, authentication, and file storage, which drastically reduces backend development effort.
-   **Consequences:**
    -   **Positive:**
        -   Significantly accelerates development by abstracting away infrastructure and common backend services.
        -   Provides a scalable, serverless architecture from day one.
        -   Simplifies the CI/CD pipeline.
    -   **Risks / Trade-offs:**
        -   Creates a dependency on two third-party vendors. While Supabase is open-source, migrating away from the managed platform would be a significant effort.
        -   We have less fine-grained control over the infrastructure compared to a traditional cloud provider like AWS or GCP.
