# Security and Performance

This section defines the key requirements and strategies for ensuring the application is secure, fast, and reliable.

### Security Requirements

- **Frontend Security:**
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP):** A strict CSP will be configured in `next.config.js` to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) by restricting the sources from which scripts, styles, and other assets can be loaded.
    - **Secure Cookie Attributes:** All session cookies, managed by the Supabase auth library, will be configured with `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite=Lax` attributes to prevent access from client-side scripts and protect against CSRF attacks.

- **Backend Security:**
    - **Input Validation:** All incoming API request bodies, parameters, and headers will be rigorously validated using a schema-based library like `zod`. Any request that fails validation will be rejected with a `400 Bad Request` error.
    - **Authorization (RLS):** The primary authorization mechanism will be PostgreSQL's Row-Level Security (RLS), configured in Supabase. This ensures that users can only access data associated with their store, providing a strong, database-level security guarantee.
    - **CORS Policy:** The Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy will be configured in Next.js to only allow requests from our specific frontend domain.

- **Authentication Security:**
    - **Password Policy:** All password requirements (length, complexity) and hashing are managed by the battle-tested Supabase Auth service.
    - **JWT Handling:** JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) are short-lived and are automatically refreshed by the Supabase client library, which securely stores them in `HttpOnly` cookies.

### Performance Optimization

- **Frontend Performance:**
    - **Loading Strategy:** We will leverage Next.js's capabilities for performance:
        - **Static Site Generation (SSG):** For public, non-dynamic pages like the landing page or blog.
        - **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** For pages that require fresh data on every request, like a user's dashboard.
        - **Code Splitting:** Automatic per-page code splitting by Next.js. We will also use `next/dynamic` for manually splitting large components.
    - **Image Optimization:** Use the built-in `next/image` component to automatically optimize, resize, and serve images in modern formats like WebP.
    - **Caching:** Vercel's Edge Network will automatically cache static assets and SSG pages globally.

- **Backend Performance:**
    - **Response Time Target:** The 95th percentile (P95) response time for all core API endpoints should be under **200ms**.
    - **Database Optimization:** Proper database indexes will be created for all foreign key columns and any columns that are frequently used in `WHERE` clauses to ensure fast query performance.
    - **Serverless Cold Starts:** We will monitor cold start times for our serverless functions and use provisioned concurrency or keep-alive strategies if they become a significant issue.

## Offline Capability Strategy

To meet the critical requirement for offline and intermittent connectivity, the application will be enhanced with PWA capabilities. The strategy involves a Service Worker for caching, IndexedDB for local data storage, and a background synchronization mechanism.

### 1. Service Worker for Caching & Offline UI

A service worker will be implemented to provide reliable offline access to the application shell.

-   **App Shell Caching:** On first visit, the service worker will cache the core UI components, CSS, and JavaScript needed to render the application. This ensures that the application loads instantly on subsequent visits, even without a network connection.
-   **Network Request Interception:** The service worker will intercept network requests. For static assets, it will use a "Cache-First" strategy. For API requests, it will use a "Network-First" strategy, falling back to cached data when offline.

### 2. Local Data Storage (IndexedDB)

`IndexedDB` will be used for storing application data in the browser, providing a persistent local database.

-   **Data Caching:** Data fetched from the API (e.g., product lists) will be stored in IndexedDB. The UI will read from this local database first, providing an "offline-first" experience.
-   **Mutation Queue:** When a user performs a write operation (e.g., creating a sale) while offline, the action will be added to a "mutation queue" in IndexedDB instead of being sent to the network.

### 3. Background Synchronization

A background synchronization process will sync the local data with the backend.

-   **Sync Trigger:** The `online` browser event will be used to detect when connectivity is restored.
-   **Processing the Queue:** Once online, the application will iterate through the mutation queue and send each queued action to the appropriate backend API endpoint.
-   **Conflict Resolution:** The initial strategy will be "last write wins". If a sync fails due to a conflict (e.g., another cashier sold the last item), the API will return a specific error, and the UI will notify the user that their action could not be completed.

**Implementation Notes:**
-   We will use a library like `@tanstack/react-query-persist-client` with a custom persister for IndexedDB to simplify caching of server state.
-   The mutation queue and background sync logic will be a custom implementation.
